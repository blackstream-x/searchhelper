Description: |
    This program can be used for a quick search over multiple URLs organized in different categories.
    After entering the search term and clicking on the 'Open' button or hitting the <Return> key, search results will open in new browser windows or tabs.
    The placeholder 'url_count_per_category' (in curly braces) creates a list of categories and count of URLs per category as follows:
    {url_count_per_category}
